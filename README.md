# How to run Notebooks

For each notebook above, you will find an open in colab link just before the first line. Please prefer to follow this link and view each notebook in the google colab environment. This will let you see the results when I executed each notebook.

The data is hosted on my Google drive account as colab does not (as far as I know) offer storage. So if you try to run each notebook, you may not succeed because you cannot load the data from my own Google drive. You can download the data and host on your own drive using the link here:

If that does not work then you can email me at kay_taylor@outlook.com and I will email you a zip archive or something.

Cheers.
